This ArteFact directory contains the following files:

- BLCTool.jar : a jar file containing a java executable of my system.

- Demo.java : is the source file of a class implementing a demo program
  for understanding and assessing the system. (For information: It can be
  modified and re-compiled using the jar file as a class path, but
  this is not necessary for executing the system: the jar file already contains
  a file Demo.class)

- Tutorial.pdf : explains how to use end check the system
  with the files in the directory testdata.

- commands, commands2 : command lines that you can execute to test the system
  (assuming you have few time or no imagination for inventing your own test cases).

- testdata : a directory containing test files to assess the system.

- papers : a directory containing papers related to the system.
  
  The papers in the directory 'papers' are not in a final version but they
  already provide useful information on how the system works:

  - ComparingExpressions.pdf describes in a generic way the algorithms I, IA, E, 
  EUF, EA, EP, EBLC available in the system.

  - Derivatives.pdf explains the notion of derivatives used in the system and the
  algorithms to compute set of equations (DFA) based on them.

  - EarlyDraft.pdf is an early attempt at describing the objective of the system
  and its architecture. It describes some algorithms not described elsewhere.

  - Tool.pdf is a previous attempt at describing practically what the system does.
